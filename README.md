### Warhammer Army Builder

My database is of a list of units found in the Imperial Guard codex. The general idea is that you are able to look at the units available to you and build an army list based on that. You are able to view a single unit by its ID or all units in the codex at once. Once you have created an army list, you are able to add units to the army list. This can be done from the list of all units or the single unit view. After adding a unit to your army list, you are able to view the whole army you have created and modify it or delete units from the list as you choose. Points values of units matter. If you try to add a unit to the army list but the units points would push the army list total over the initial limit, you are told that the unit failed to add and by how many points you were over.

For purposes of an ever evolving game, you are also able to add, update, and delete items from the overall codex. This lets you correct unit stat errors or adjust them to match new rules as well as creating/deleting new/outdated units. These changes are done at the database level.

Goals for next time:

1. Adding more tables to the database. This would let me include special rules and equipment for a more detailed army list.
2. Adding points values instead of power level. Currently my website implements a rudimentary point system. If I added more tables that included special rules and equipment, I would also like to increase the complexity of the army list builder to match.
3. Html/CSS work. I added in some basic css to spruce up my html, but the site does not look as clean as I would like it to. Hopefully I can develop my css skills to better beautify my pages. (add/delete units, I would like the words to be lined up and the text boxes to be lined up separately)
