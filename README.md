### Warhammer Army Builder

My database is of a list of fictional units for a tabletop game. The general idea is that you are able to look at the units available to you and build an army list to use in tabletop games. You are able to view a single unit by its ID or all units at once. Once you have created an army list with a points value of your choosing, you are able to add units to the army list. This can be done from the list of all units or the single unit view. After adding a unit to your army list, you are able to view the whole army you have created and modify it or delete units from the list as you choose. Points values of units matter. If you try to add a unit to the army list but the units points would push the army list total over the initial limit, you are told that the unit failed to add and by how many points you were over.

For purposes of an ever evolving game, you are also able to add, update, and delete items from the overall list. This lets you correct unit stat errors or adjust them to match new rules as well as creating/deleting new/outdated units. These changes are done at the database level.

This project was done using SpringMVC, Java, and MySql as the main technologies.
